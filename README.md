A basic resource pack for 1.12 PvP players :D

## Resource pack

A minimal Minecraft Java Edition **1.12** resource pack was added to this repository.

If you'd like, I can:

- Add more custom textures (we can pick specific blocks/items)
- Add sounds, fonts, or more advanced changes
- Generate higher-resolution textures (32x32, 64x64) and include them

Tell me which assets you'd like to change next and I will implement them. 🔧
