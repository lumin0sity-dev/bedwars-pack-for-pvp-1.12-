# bedwars-pack-for-pvp-1.12-
A basic resource pack for 1.12 PvP players :D

## Resource pack

A minimal Minecraft Java Edition **1.12** resource pack was added to this repository.

- Build script: `create_pack.sh` (generates `bedwars-pvp-1.12-resourcepack.zip`)
- Pack metadata: `resourcepack/pack.mcmeta` (uses `pack_format: 3` for 1.11–1.12)

To create the downloadable ZIP run:

```bash
bash create_pack.sh
```

Then move `bedwars-pvp-1.12-resourcepack.zip` to your Minecraft `resourcepacks` folder and enable it in the in-game Resource Packs menu.

If you'd like, I can:

- Add more custom textures (we can pick specific blocks/items)
- Add sounds, fonts, or more advanced changes
- Generate higher-resolution textures (32x32, 64x64) and include them

Tell me which assets you'd like to change next and I will implement them. 🔧
